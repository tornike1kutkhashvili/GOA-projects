<p>The BMW M5 is a high-performance version of the BMW 5 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH, built
from 1992 to 1995, 2006 to 2010, and since 2024. The M5 has continuously been produced in the saloon body style,
in some countries also as a estate.[1][2][3]
The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the 
fastest production saloon at the time.[4] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984,
 with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</p>
